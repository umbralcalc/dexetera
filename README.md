# dexetera

A home for interesting projects and testing out ideas - all defined by stochadex configs.

## Initial setup

You'll need to have the [stochadex binary](https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex) built and somewhere on your system. Once this has been done, you'll be able to run the tests if you set your local environment variable like so:

```shell
export STOCHADEX_PATH=/path/to/repo/stochadex
```

You can also run any of the configs here like this:

```shell
${STOCHADEX_PATH}/bin/stochadex --config ./any_config_here.yaml
```
