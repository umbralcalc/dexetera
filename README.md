# dexetera

A home for interesting projects and testing out ideas - all defined by stochadex configs. 

## Initial setup

You'll need to have the [stochadex binary](https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex) built and somewhere on your system. Once this has been done, you can run any of the configs here like this:

```shell
/path/to/binary/stochadex --config ./any_config_here.yaml
```
